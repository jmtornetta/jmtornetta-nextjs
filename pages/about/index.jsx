                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>When I am not working, I spend my time with my fianc√©e, outdoors (hiking, camping, fishing, bushcrafting), or exercising (martial arts, HIIT, yoga, gym).</p>
                <p>I write a bit but not regularly. I have written for several healthcare publications. I also like writing poetry and riddles.</p>
                <p>I enjoy reading about psychology, biographies, business, philosophy, science-fiction, and fantasy. I prefer books that have been around for a while.</p>

            <section id="values">
                <h2>Values</h2>
                <p>I like to take the extra time to focus and do great work. This applies whether I am refactoring code, setting up scalable business infrastructure, or ensuring a client fully understands their options.</p>
                <p>I always attempt to stand by my word. Also:</p>
                <ol className="ml-4 list-decimal">
                    <li>I enjoy building things and fixing things.</li>
                    <li>I never break a promise.</li>
                    <li>I never give up.</li>

                    <h2>Programming</h2>
                    <p>I like creating and maintaining declarative, functional programs for the web.</p>
                    <p>I believe in building things that last. I like minimizing uneditable dependencies for projects.</p>
                    <p>When using dependencies, I select those that maintain this philosophy. I like choosing the simplest (i.e. least moving parts) tool possible to get efficient, clean work done.</p>
                    <p>Some of my front-end work includes:</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p>Some of my CLI and back-end work includes:</p>

                        <li>Automatic fitness class extractor {"=>"} Converts public fitness classes from dozens of websites to JSON objects in a single schedule object.</li>
