For moments,  
Feel what eludes touch.  
For seconds,  
Hear what cannot be seen.  
For minutes,  
Imagine dragons singing.  
For what is sought,  
Hails from above;   
Often after dark,  
Always after light.   
Thrown behind Mars,  
Tossed ahead Saturn.  
Swung after Wednesday,   
Flung before Friday.  
Feared by mortals,  
And wielded by gods.
