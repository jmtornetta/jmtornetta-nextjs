I break like crystal glass  
I float as leaves of grass  
I'm far, atop a pole  
I'm in your fruit punch bowl  
Hold me close, if you're hurt  
Or, to remove that wart  
I love delicious treats  
I'm captive with raw meats   
You'll guess me right,  
Just keep your cool  
Or wait and see   
Me after Yule
